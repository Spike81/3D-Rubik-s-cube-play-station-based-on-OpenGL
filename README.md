# 3D-Rubik-s-cube-play-station-based-on-OpenGL
In this project, students were asked to complete a 3D simulation of a real-world scene using knowledge related to computer graphics and openGL functions. Moreover, there should be some static and dynamic objects in the scene, and some graphic techniques such as geometric creation, hierarchical modelling, lighting, and textures should be applied. Therefore, a modeling of a 3D Rubik's cube play station with relative high playability and interactivity that can reflect the real scene was implemented in this project. And it meets the goals mentioned above relatively well.
